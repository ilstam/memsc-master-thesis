\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my tutors Adam Lackorzynski and
Carsten Weinhold for supervising this thesis, answering questions, and helping
me to understand Linux and \llinux internals. I also want to thank my former
colleague Nick Sampanis for helping me identify a race condition bug in my
code. Appreciation is due to my former mentor and good friend William Brown as
well, for previously introducing me to many synchronization (and other)
concepts having knowledge of which proved to be very useful in this work.
Finally, I would like to thank my parents for making it easier for me to attend
TU Dresden by funding a large part of my studies, but most importantly, for
their unconditional and endless support in every moment of my life.
